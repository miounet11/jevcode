# Awesome Jev by TypeSafe

An evidence-backed, practical collection of use cases, patterns, prompts, and starter code for **Jev**, TypeSafe AI’s first **System One Model**.

Jev is built for software that needs a judgment, not a paragraph:

```text
text or JSON state + typed questions → constrained answers + probabilities → your code
```

Use it to classify, route, score, detect, rank, extract, verify, and gate automation. Keep the final control flow, thresholds, and side effects in code.

> This is an independent community collection. It is not an official TypeSafe AI repository. Product behavior, prices, limits, and model aliases can change.
>
> Snapshot reviewed: **September 18, 2026.**

## The short version

Most LLMs produce strings for people. Jev evaluates a state against questions whose answer spaces you define in advance. It returns typed values and probability distributions that ordinary software can branch on.

That makes Jev a good fit for the fuzzy middle between brittle rules and expensive generative workflows:

| If your application needs to… | Reach for… |
|---|---|
| Pick one value from a known set | `Choice` |
| Measure a position on an ordered rubric | `Score` |
| Estimate whether a condition is true | `Noul` |
| Decide whether to act, review, or fall back | probabilities + confidence + code |
| Write an explanation, code, or a reply | an LLM, optionally after Jev routes or verifies it |

## Quick start

### Python

The official Python SDK reads `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from the environment and defaults to `jev-latest`.

```bash
python -m pip install typesafe-sdk
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY="your-key"
python examples/python/quickstart.py
```

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient

state = {
    "ticket": "I was charged twice and need the duplicate refunded today.",
    "account_tier": "business",
}

with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    response = client.system_one(
        state=state,
        questions={
            "intent": Choice(
                instructions="What is the customer's main request?",
                criteria={
                    "refund": "The customer wants money returned.",
                    "technical_help": "The customer needs a bug or integration fixed.",
                    "information": "The customer is asking for information only.",
                    "other": "None of the other options clearly fits.",
                },
            ),
            "is_urgent": Noul(
                instructions="Does the ticket explicitly communicate time pressure?",
            ),
            "frustration": Score(
                instructions="How frustrated does the customer appear?",
                criteria=[
                    "Calm and neutral",
                    "Concerned but civil",
                    "Very angry or using strong language",
                ],
            ),
        },
    )

print(response.answers["intent"].choice)
print(response.answers["intent"].probabilities)
print(response.answers["is_urgent"].noul)
print(response.answers["frustration"].score)
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript

```bash
npm install @typesafe-ai/sdk
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY="your-key"
npx tsx examples/typescript/quickstart.ts
```

```ts
import { choice, noul, score, TypeSafeClient } from "@typesafe-ai/sdk";

const client = new TypeSafeClient();
const result = await client.systemOne({
  state: {
    ticket: "I was charged twice and need the duplicate refunded today.",
  },
  questions: {
    intent: choice("What is the customer's main request?", {
      refund: "The customer wants money returned.",
      technical_help: "The customer needs a bug or integration fixed.",
      information: "The customer is asking for information only.",
      other: "None of the other options clearly fits.",
    }),
    isUrgent: noul("Does the ticket explicitly communicate time pressure?"),
    frustration: score("How frustrated does the customer appear?", [
      "Calm and neutral",
      "Concerned but civil",
      "Very angry or using strong language",
    ]),
  },
});

console.log(result.answers.intent.choice);
console.log(result.answers.isUrgent.noul);
console.log(result.answers.frustration.score);
```

See the [official Python SDK](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python), [official JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-js), and [Quick start](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/quickstart) for the supported client options.

## The three primitives

Each question should ask for one focused judgment about the same state. Several questions can be sent in one request and are evaluated independently.

### `Choice`: one known option

Use it for intent, department, document type, tool name, risk category, or any other unordered finite set. Include `other` or `none_of_the_above` when your options may not cover reality.

```python
"department": Choice(
    instructions="Which team should own this ticket?",
    criteria={
        "billing": "Payments, invoices, refunds, or charges.",
        "technical": "Bugs, outages, or integrations.",
        "account": "Access, profile, or account administration.",
        "other": "None of the teams above clearly fits.",
    },
)
```

Returns the selected `choice`, a probability for every option, and `confidence`.

### `Score`: a position on an ordered rubric

Use it for severity, relevance, frustration, quality, suitability, or complexity. Define what each level means. The returned `score` is probability-weighted and may land between levels.

```python
"severity": Score(
    instructions="How severe is the customer-facing impact of this incident?",
    criteria=[
        "Minor inconvenience; workaround available",
        "Material degradation; some users affected",
        "Critical outage; core workflow blocked",
    ],
)
```

Returns `score`, `legend`, `probabilities`, and `confidence`.

### `Noul`: probability that a statement is true

Use it when the probability itself is useful: “Does this request ask for a refund?”, “Does this passage answer the question?”, or “Is this prompt a jailbreak attempt?”

```python
"contains_prompt_injection": Noul(
    instructions="Does the user-provided text attempt to override the application's instructions?",
)
```

Returns `noul` from `0` to `1`. Near `0.5` means the question is uncertain; it is not a medium score.

## Core patterns

| Pattern | Shape | Where it shines |
|---|---|---|
| Atomic questions | One narrow question per judgment | Reliable, inspectable workflow logic |
| Speculative fan-out | Ask every likely-needed question in one call; ignore irrelevant answers in code | Support triage, smart-home commands, agent routing |
| Confidence-gated routing | Treat answer and confidence as separate axes | Automation with human fallback |
| Composite scoring | Normalize several Scores and combine with explicit weights | Candidate, lead, vendor, and risk ranking |
| Intent routing | Choose deterministic code, specialist LLM, or human | Cost and latency control |
| Two-stage dependency | Make a second call only when the first answer changes the next state or options | Hierarchical classification, structure recovery |

The important design rule is: **questions describe judgments; code owns composition, thresholds, and side effects.**

## Use-case map

The following cases are practical starting points, not promises that Jev will be correct for every domain. Each one is a small decision system with a clear output contract.

### Workflow control

#### 1. Support inbox triage

Classify the request, detect urgency and refund intent, score frustration, then route with ordinary code. Ask all dimensions together—even bug severity that matters only for bug reports—using [speculative fan-out](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/fan-out).

```python
if result.answers["intent"].choice == "technical_help":
    if result.answers["severity"].score >= 1.5:
        escalate_to_engineering()
    else:
        add_to_bug_backlog()
elif result.answers["intent"].choice == "refund":
    route_to_billing()
```

Evidence: [TypeSafe’s support fan-out pattern](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/fan-out) and [customer-support use cases](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/use-case-map).

#### 2. Intent and model routing

Put a cheap, fast decision layer in front of deterministic handlers, specialist LLMs, and human agents. Let confidence decide when a category is safe to trust.

Evidence: [Intent routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/intent-routing).

#### 3. Confidence-gated actions

Use lower thresholds for reversible read-only actions and higher thresholds for risky operations. For example, show a balance at one threshold, ask for confirmation before a transfer at another, and send ambiguous commands to a human.

Evidence: [Confidence-gated routing](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/confidence-routing).

#### 4. Typed function and tool dispatch

Map a natural-language command to a function name and closed-set arguments. Jev chooses only from the values your function accepts; code still validates authorization, required fields, and side effects before execution.

Evidence: [Function-calling cookbook](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/function_calling).

### Retrieval and knowledge

#### 5. RAG passage filtering

Score relevance, answer support, contradiction, and prompt-injection risk for each retrieved passage. Pass only evidence that clears your application’s thresholds to the answering model.

Evidence: [Classifying RAG passages](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/classifying_rag_passages).

#### 6. Semantic search and re-ranking

Use BM25 or embeddings to create a shortlist, then score each query–candidate pair with a `Noul` and sort by the returned value. This gives the semantic stage a numeric signal without asking a generative model to invent a scale.

Evidence: [Re-ranking cookbook](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/rerank_typesafe) and [line-by-line search](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/semantic_find).

Community implementation: [Jev Search](https://github.com/superagents-lab/jev-search) uses the user's request and retrieved titles and snippets as state, asks Jev `Noul` questions about each result's relevance, then uses application code to deduplicate URLs, sort results, and group lower-scoring matches separately. It also uses `Choice` and `Noul` judgments to select query candidates, time ranges, and sources before retrieval through Search1API; the [live demo](https://jev.s1.dev) displays links and snippets with relevance scores, which are model judgments rather than verified accuracy. This is an independent Search1API project, not an official TypeSafe product.

#### 7. Citation and claim verification

Compare a claim, its cited passage, and the source document. Ask whether the passage supports, contradicts, or fails to establish the claim, and route low-confidence results to review.

Evidence: [Double-checking citations](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/citation_check).

#### 8. Knowledge-graph entity alignment

For each candidate pair, choose `merge`, `leave_unlinked`, or `curator_review`, or score how likely the records refer to the same entity. Keep the final merge policy deterministic and auditable.

Evidence: [Knowledge-graph entity alignment](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/entity_alignment).

### Safety and quality

#### 9. LLM input/output guardrails

Screen prompts, generated replies, and tool calls with hazard `Noul`s and a harm `Score`. Your policy can pass, review, block, or route instead of relying only on a system prompt.

Evidence: [Guardrails for LLMs](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/llm_guardrails).

#### 10. Semantic code and writing linting

Turn team conventions into narrow yes/no checks and run them in CI. Use the result to annotate a pull request or request review; do not silently rewrite code or policy text.

Evidence: [Semantic code linting in the TypeSafe use-case map](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/use-case-map).

#### 11. Policy, compliance, and document verification

Check contracts, filings, marketing claims, or support replies against explicit requirements. Return structured findings and escalate high-impact or ambiguous cases to a named reviewer.

Evidence: [Legal and compliance use cases](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/use-case-map).

#### 12. Self-consistency and uncertain labels

Add an explicit uncertain option to a moderation or classification space, or compare repeated decisions on high-risk inputs. Use disagreement as a review signal, not as a reason to blindly majority-vote.

Evidence: [TypeSafe’s self-consistency cookbooks](https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt).

### Data and operations

#### 13. Structured extraction with validation

Recover known fields from messy text by first finding candidate spans with deterministic code, then using Jev to choose the requested span or label. Normalize dates, amounts, and identifiers in code and validate them before storage.

Evidence: [Pre-parsed value extraction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/pre_parsed_value_extraction_cookbook) and [date extraction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/date_extraction_cookbook).

#### 14. Composite candidate, lead, or vendor scoring

Score independent dimensions—such as role evidence, technical depth, and communication—then combine normalized values with weights you own. The same design works for lead fit, vendor risk, ad suitability, and claim complexity.

Evidence: [Composite scoring](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/composite-scoring).

#### 15. Feature extraction for classical ML

Convert language into probabilistic features such as purchase intent, churn signals, competitive pressure, or complaint severity, then feed them into a supervised model alongside structured features.

Evidence: [Feature extraction use cases](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/use-case-map).

#### 16. High-cardinality and hierarchical classification

For large taxonomies, use staged choices or a probability-aware beam. Let the first decision choose a branch and ask a second question only when the next option set depends on that branch.

Evidence: [Hierarchical classification](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/hierarchical_classification).

### Real-time and agentic systems

#### 17. Smart-home and UI command control

Fan out across command category, domain, device type, and action in one request. Use deterministic code for permissions and execution, and hand general conversation to a generative model when the request is outside the closed command space.

Evidence: [Smart-home demo](https://docs.typesafe.ai/demos/smart-home).

#### 18. Agent harness routing and skill suggestion

Use Jev to decide whether a turn needs a skill, tool, retrieval step, or expensive reasoning model. Keep tool descriptions, authorization, and stop conditions outside the model’s answer space.

Evidence: [Agent skill](https://docs.typesafe.ai/agent-skill) and [skill-suggestion cookbook](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/skill_suggestion).

Community implementation: [Augustus](https://github.com/24601/Augustus) takes the desired software behavior as state, decomposes it into typed `Choice`, `Score`, and `Noul` questions about where semantic judgment belongs, and keeps thresholds, composition, and side effects in application code. It ships a decision-design card and requires a smallest falsifying experiment before a design is treated as settled. Independent agent skill, not an official TypeSafe product.

### Recent workflow evaluations and cookbook patterns

The following additions come from TypeSafe’s current workflow evaluations and cookbooks. They are useful reference architectures, not guarantees that a model decision is correct. Keep arithmetic, authorization, thresholds, and side effects in code.

#### 19. Security incident response

Join an alert with asset context, open tickets, registered devices, maintenance windows, and standing authorizations. Ask whether the activity is unauthorized, whether an existing record explains it, and how strong the evidence is; then let a deterministic playbook choose close, queue, notify, or containment. Only ask deeper questions about credentials, sessions, processes, and spread after the first branch requires them.

Source: [Security Incidents workflow](https://evals.typesafe.ai/security_incidents).

#### 20. Agent-trace observability

Review a completed agent run—including instructions, conversation, tool calls, final response, and feedback—for permission breaches, task completion, satisfaction, expectation gaps, and silent failures. Route the trace to auto-close, human review, bug filing, or on-call escalation.

Source: [Agent Trace Observability workflow](https://evals.typesafe.ai/agent_trace_observability).

#### 21. Invoice matching and payment controls

Evaluate an invoice against its purchase order, contract, vendor record, prior invoices, correspondence, delivery evidence, and approvals. Use Jev for semantic checks such as duplicate/fraud/wrong-vendor signals and use code for totals, dates, account numbers, and payment execution. Emit actions such as pay, schedule, hold, dispute lines, request correction, or route for approval.

Source: [Invoice Processing workflow](https://evals.typesafe.ai/invoice_processing).

#### 22. Multi-action customer service

Treat a support turn as a set of possible actions rather than a single intent label: say something, refund, freeze a card, set an intent, hand off, flag for review, or close. Fan out over intent, frustration, urgency, consent, fraud, legal risk, and requests for a person; then verify the assistant’s previous claims against account records before allowing a consequential action.

Source: [Customer Service workflow](https://evals.typesafe.ai/customer_service).

#### 23. Expense-claim approval

Check receipt readability, classify the expense, compare meal claims with a policy threshold, and route only the exceptions for approval. Sums and other deterministic calculations belong in code; Jev supplies the semantic readings that select the next rule.

Source: [Expense Claims example in the workflow evals](https://evals.typesafe.ai/).

#### 24. Confidence-aware insurance claims triage

Run a claims rubric as independent `Noul`s for coverage, exclusions, documentation, fraud indicators, review requirements, and related conditions. Preserve each probability and map a middle band to `uncertain`/human review rather than forcing pay or deny.

Source: [Self-consistency for Nouls](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/consistency_noul_cookbook) and [insurance claims on the use-case map](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/use-case-map).

#### 25. Abstaining content moderation

Use `Choice` questions for labels such as threat, spam, and general content, with an explicit uncertain outcome or confidence gate. This lets a moderation system measure label stability and send borderline posts to review instead of turning close probabilities into automatic removals.

Source: [Self-consistency for Choices](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/consistency_choice_cookbook) and [moderation and trust & safety](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/use-case-map).

#### 26. Batched regulatory and policy review

Ask many independent questions about one long document in one request—for example, whether a policy contains particular obligations, exceptions, or prohibited claims—then use code to assemble the briefing. This is a map-reduce-shaped workflow for document corpora: retrieve or split in code, evaluate in batches, aggregate deterministically.

Source: [Parallel questions](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/parallel_questions).

#### 27. Structure recovery from messy text

Recover headings, lists, code blocks, callouts, and paragraph boundaries from plain text that lost its formatting. Use one pass to reconnect hard-wrapped lines and a second typed classification pass for blocks; keep the final Markdown renderer deterministic.

Source: [Structure recovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoformat.md).

#### 28. Verified structured-data extraction cascades

Have a small generative model extract candidate fields, use Jev `Noul`s to check whether each value is missing, unrelated, or unsupported by the source, and escalate only failed fields to a larger reasoning model. This is useful for invoices, claims, applications, and forms where extraction quality matters more than free-form prose.

Source: [SDE cascade](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/sde_cascade).

#### 29. Autoresearch for semantic ML features

Let a research loop propose Jev questions, turn free text into numeric `Score`/`Noul` features, train a downstream supervised model, inspect held-out errors, and propose the next questions. The feature table, validation split, and final model stay under ordinary ML tooling.

Source: [Autoresearch feature discovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoresearch_feature_discovery).

#### 30. Confidence-aware hierarchical classification

Classify a document into a fine-grained taxonomy, then use the returned confidence to decide whether to report the narrow label, roll up to a parent category, or ask for review. This avoids a second model call when the taxonomy already provides a safe fallback.

Source: [Classification using confidence](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/classification_using_confidence).

#### 31. Real-time game-state and high-cardinality control

When a program can describe the current state and legal actions, Jev can make a fast decision inside the loop: choose a move from a generated action set, or choose the next link from a large frontier such as a Wikiracing page. Keep collision checks, legal-action generation, game rules, deadlines, and fallback actions in code.

Source: [TypeSafe’s launch examples for real-time applications, Doom, and Wikiracing](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev).

A useful implementation boundary is:

1. **Inspect** the state and decide which judgments the workflow needs.
2. **Evaluate** atomic questions together where they share the same state.
3. **Compose** answers, probabilities, and business rules in code.
4. **Gate** side effects by risk-specific thresholds.
5. **Record** the version, question definitions, distributions, chosen path, and reviewer outcome.
6. **Calibrate** thresholds on representative labeled data and revisit them after model or policy changes.

## What Jev is not

- It is not a chatbot, copywriter, code generator, or explanation engine.
- It does not return arbitrary strings. The answer space comes from the question you define.
- It is not a guarantee that a semantic judgment is correct. Calibration describes groups of predictions, not any individual answer.
- It is not a replacement for authorization, deterministic validation, policy enforcement, or human review in high-impact workflows.
- It does not currently accept images, audio, or video.

When you need a free-form answer, pair Jev with a generative model: let Jev route, retrieve, verify, or guard the call, then let the LLM write within the boundaries your application enforces.

## Safety and reliability checklist

- Keep API keys server-side and restrict which services may call the endpoint.
- Include an `other`, `unknown`, or `review` option whenever the option list can be incomplete.
- Set thresholds per action and risk level; do not copy one global threshold across the system.
- Treat low confidence as a first-class branch: ask for clarification, use a fallback, or involve a person.
- Version state schemas, question instructions, criteria, and policy code together.
- Log the versioned model returned in the response, not only the alias sent in the request.
- Store probability distributions for audit and calibration, not just the winning label.
- Use the SDK’s default retry behavior for `429` and `529`, or implement exponential backoff for direct HTTP calls.
- Make side effects an explicit second step after inspection and approval.
- Evaluate with your own representative cases, including ambiguity, adversarial text, missing fields, and out-of-domain inputs.

## Contributing

Useful contributions are small, reproducible, and honest about uncertainty:

- add a use case with a clear state, question contract, code-owned policy, and source;
- include a fixture or offline test when behavior can be checked without an API key;
- report model version, date, thresholds, and evaluation set for performance claims;
- separate TypeSafe-reported results from your own measurements;
- avoid putting credentials, private customer data, or irreversible actions in examples.

### Adding your implementation

Built something on Jev? Open a PR that adds one row to the [Recent independent implementations](#recent-independent-implementations) table (or a short "Community implementation" note under the closest matching use case if a table row doesn't fit). To get merged quickly:

1. **Keep the diff small.** One row or one short paragraph, in the closest matching section. Don't reformat unrelated content in the same PR.
2. **Name it, don't sell it.** One sentence on what state it evaluates, what typed questions it asks (`Choice` / `Score` / `Noul`), and where application code owns policy, thresholds, or side effects.
3. **Disclose affiliation.** Say in the PR description if you built or maintain the project. That's fine — this list is for independent implementations, not just third-party ones — but it must be stated.
4. **Link to evidence.** A public repo, and ideally the specific file(s) that call the Jev API, so reviewers can verify the claim without trusting the description.
5. **Make it inspectable.** Public source, a license, and a README that explains setup and any data sent to providers. No closed demos as the only evidence.
6. **Don't overclaim.** No unverified performance/benchmark numbers. Mark experimental or dry-run-only paths (e.g., trading, financial, or home-automation actions) explicitly.
